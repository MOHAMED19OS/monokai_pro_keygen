## Note
This project was originally developed as a python script and then evolved into the more useful web version that is currently used as a default one. You still can access the old utility source code on `legacy/python` git branch.

The [releases page](https://github.com/maximilionus/monokai_pro_keygen/releases) contains the original builds of python version and is therefore considered **legacy** and hidden from the project home.
